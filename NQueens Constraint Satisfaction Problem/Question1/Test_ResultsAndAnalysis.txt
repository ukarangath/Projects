Question1:
-------------
a. How many assignments are made solving 8-queens? 10-queens? 15-
queens? 20-queens?
-------------
Ans : 
8-queens - 218
10-queens - 194
15-queens - 2703
20-queens - 399250
b. Can you solve 100-queens in a reasonable amount of time? If so, how
many assignments are made?
-------------
Ans : 
No

Analysis : 
Backtracking algorithm is kind of uninformed search.This algorithm does not 
give good performance compared to other algorithms.It does not have any ways to
forecast the failure.This is is biggest disadvantage of this algorithm.
Due to this reason,for solving NQueens with higher orders takes very long time.
