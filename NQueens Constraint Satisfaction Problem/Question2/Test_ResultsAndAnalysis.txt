Question2:
-------------
a. How many assignments are made solving 8-queens? 10-queens? 15-
queens? 20-queens?
-------------
Ans : 
8-queens - 8
10-queens - 10
15-queens - 1625
20-queens - 20
b. Can you solve 100-queens in a reasonable amount of time? If so, how
many assignments are made?
-------------
Ans : 
Yes,100assignments.
c. What is the largest problem you can solve in less than a minute? How
many assignments are made?
-------------
Ans:5000.
Odd and even N has different effect.Certain odd values of N takes longer time 
but even values takes less time comparatively.
Eg: 15 queens

Analysis : 
Least-constraining-value heuristics gives solution faster than just back tracking alone.
This assigns the value to most constrained value first which reduces the chance to back track.
