Question3:
-------------
a. How many assignments are made solving 8-queens? 10-queens? 15-
queens? 20-queens?
-------------
Ans : 
8-queens - 218
10-queens - 194
15-queens - 2703
20-queens - Gives out of memory error
b. Can you solve 100-queens in a reasonable amount of time? If so, how
many assignments are made?
-------------
Ans : 
No.
c. What is the largest problem you can solve in less than a minute? How
many assignments are made?
-------------
Ans:
N = 19
Max possible with eclipse stack size of 512kb is N = 19,with assignments equal to 5071

Analysis : 
AC3 canâ€™t detect all contradictions among binary constraints.But still it does more 
work than forward checking,specially AC3 with complete look ahead.Due to the same reason this algorithm takes 
too much of time.
Note : Here I have given total number of assignments during consistency check with another matrix.
This may not be the real number of assignments as per the question.In a arc consistency check 
with complete look ahead the final number of assignments is N.
