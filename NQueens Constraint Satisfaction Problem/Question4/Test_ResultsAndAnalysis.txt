Question4:
-------------
a. How does the time to solve 8, 10, 15, 20, 100 queens compare with the
backtracking search?
-------------
Ans : 
(MAX_STEPS : 100)
8-queens - 17 ms
10-queens - 3ms - no solution found in 100 runs
15-queens - 7ms
20-queens - 12ms
100-queens - 90ms
b. What is the largest problem you can solve in less than a minute? How
many assignments are made?
-------------
Ans:Solution depends on luck.
5000 queens.
Took 62845 ms
Total number of assignments for - 5000-queen problem is : 100
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis : 
Backtracking algorithm is better in time perspective.
But at back tracking method,solution is guaranteed but here it 
depends on luck.Only benefit at min-conflicts local search is,any number of queens problem we can solve in a 
reasonable time if lucky.
